<p>:sunflower: :octopus: The MEE (Models in Ecology and Evolution) seminar is organized by Ph.D. students and post-docs and is targeted at young researchers (M.Sc, Ph.D. students, post-docs…:mortar_board:) interested in theoretical approaches in Ecology and Evolution, with three major objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>:dragon_face: giving an overview of current modeling techniques used in ecology and evolution research: which tools for which questions?</li>
<li>:bug: create a space for exchange between different methodological approaches to identify the similarities and complementarities.</li>
<li>:cactus: discuss the interest of modeling products for researchers in evolutionary ecology as for the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the seminar is designed to promote exchanges as much as possible and consists of a series of oral presentations by visiting researchers and students.</p>
<p>:dollar: Registration is free, and this year the seminar will be online.</p>
<p>:tada: Stay tuned!!</p>
